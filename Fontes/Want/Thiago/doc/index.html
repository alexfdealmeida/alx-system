<h1>Want </h1>
<p>Want is a Delphi-friendly build management tool. </p>
<p>Want was inspired by the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">
Jakarta Ant</a> tool, but tweaked to make it fast and Delphi-friendly. Want is 
written in Delphi. </p>
<h2>History </h2>
<p>I wrote most of the core classes of Want during the Spring of 2001. See the&nbsp;
<a href="history.html">Want History</a> page for&nbsp; the details about how it 
happened. </p>
<h2>The Name </h2>
<p>When I broke out of the Dante project (see the <a href="history.html">history 
page</a>) I started to think about a name for the tool I'd continue to develop. 
One of the first ideas that came to mind&nbsp; was &quot;WAnt&quot;, for &quot;Windows Ant&quot;. I 
quickly rejected the name because it didn't fit a tool that would also run on
<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, using
<a href="http://www.borland.com/kylix/">Kylix</a>, and probably on several other 
platforms through <a href="http://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a>.&nbsp; 
Then, I quickly came back to to the name: </p>
<pre>  want clean
  want compile
  want installer
  want changelog
</pre>
<p>It seemed just too comfortable to invoke the&nbsp; tool telling it what you 
&quot;want&quot;, and so the name stayed. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The project has been moved to Source Forge. You can download the latest 
releases of WANT, subscribe to the mailing lists, and post bugs or feature 
requests by visiting:</p>
<pre><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/want">http://sourceforge.net/projects/want</a></pre>
<p>The source is included in all distributions licensed under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>. </p>
<p>There are very few docs, but you may be able to get along with the binary and 
the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/">Ant Docs</a> -- with which 
Want is fairly compatible. You can also take a look at the source code for the 
tasks in the &lt;want&gt;/src/tasks directory to know what functions they provide 
(their code is really simple). </p>
<h2>Examples </h2>
<p>For a better view of the following scripts, you should download them to your 
hard disk and use your favorite editor; browsers will present the XML in ways 
different from the original text. </p>
<p>A copy of the Want <a href="want_want.xml">want.xml</a> script used to build, 
test, and package Want itself can be found <a href="want_want.xml">here</a>. </p>
<p>A copy of the <a href="dunit_want.xml">want.xml</a> script used to build
<a href="../dunit">DUnit</a> distributions with Want can be found
<a href="dunit_want.xml">here</a>. </p>
<h2>Screenshots </h2>
<p>This is a screenshot of Want building itself: </p>
