    <h1>
      Want
    </h1>
    <p>
      Want is a Delphi-friendly build management tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want was inspired by the <a href=
      "http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Jakarta Ant</a> tool,
      but tweaked to make it fast and Delphi-friendly. Want is written
      in Delphi.
    </p>
    <h2>
      History
    </h2>
    <p>
      I (<a href="../juanca/">Juanco A&ntilde;ez</a>) wrote most of the
      core classes of Want during the Spring of 2001. See the&nbsp; <a
      href="history.html">Want History</a> page for&nbsp; the details
      about how it happened.
    </p>
    <h2>
      The Name
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I broke out of the Dante project (see the <a href=
      "history.html">history page</a>) I started to think about a name
      for the tool I'd continue to develop. One of the first ideas that
      came to mind&nbsp; was "WAnt", for "Windows Ant". I quickly
      rejected the name because it didn't fit a tool that would also
      run on <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>, using <a href=
      "http://www.borland.com/kylix/">Kylix</a>, and probably on
      several other platforms through <a href=
      "http://www.freepascal.org/">Free Pascal</a>.&nbsp; Then, I
      quickly came back to to the name:
    </p>
<pre>
  want clean
  want compile
  want installer
  want changelog
</pre>
    <p>
      It seemed just too comfortable to invoke the&nbsp; tool telling it
      what you "want", and so the name stayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Availability
    </h2>
    <p>
      The current version of Want is ${version} and you can download it
      <a href="dist/${zipname}">here</a>. 
      The source is
      included, and licensed under the <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are very few docs, but you may be able to get along with
      the binary and the <a href=
      "http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/manual/">Ant Docs</a> -- with
      which Want is fairly compatible. You can also take a look at the
      source code for the tasks in the &lt;want&gt;/src/tasks directory
      to know what functions they provide (their code is really
      simple).
    </p>
    <h2>
      Examples
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a better view of the following scripts, you should download
      them to your hard disk and use your favorite editor; browsers
      will present the XML in ways different from the original text.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the Want <a href="want_want.xml">want.xml</a> script
      used to build, test, and package Want itself be found <a href=
      "want_want.xml">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A copy of the <a href="dunit_want.xml">want.xml</a> script used
      to build <a href="../dunit">DUnit</a> distributions with Want can
      be found <a href="dunit_build.xml">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Screenshots
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a screenshot of Want building itself:

      This is how an unsuccessful build may look like:
